# Mass Video File Encoder / Converter

This is an private and also my first project. Don't expect a beautiful UI.
Encoder for mass video files using ffmpeg. Built for Windows in Lazarus IDE (https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). 


** You can DOWNLOAD the latest pre-compiled version here: https://goo.gl/hH2DTS **

To work you need to compile or download an pre-compiled version of ffmpeg (visit http://ffmpeg.org). Just put it in your chosen directory path. All -FFmpeg Archives are bringing their own tested Zeranoe version of FFmpeg with them.
