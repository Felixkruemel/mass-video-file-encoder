# mass-video-file-encoder

This is an private and also my first project. Don't expect a beautiful UI.
Encoder for mass video files using ffmpeg. Built for Windows in Lazarus IDE (https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). 


You can get the latest pre-compiled version here: https://www.magentacloud.de/share/yt27ojrpfn

To work you need to compile or download an pre-compiled version of ffmpeg (visit ffmpeg.org). Just put it in your chosen directory path.
